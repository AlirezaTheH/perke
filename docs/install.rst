Installation
============
Perke is a Python package, which means you need to download and install
Python from `python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads>`_ if you haven't already. Once
you have Python installed, follow bellow steps:

- The easiest way to install is from PyPI:

  .. code:: bash

      pip install perke


  Alternatively, you can install directly from GitHub:

  .. code:: bash

      pip install git+https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git

- Perke also requires a POS tagger model that can be obtained from
  `here <https://github.com/sobhe/hazm/releases/download/v0.5/resources-0.5.zip>`_
  and must be put in
  `resources <https://github.com/alirezah320/perke/tree/master/perke/resources>`_
  directory.
