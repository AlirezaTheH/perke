If you are new to Perke, this is the place to begin. Currently, Perke
implements graph-based models. Letâ€™s see a longer example to learn how to use
these models.

.. admonition:: Example

    .. literalinclude:: ../examples/unsupervised/graph_based/single_rank.py

For other models, see the
`examples <https://github.com/alirezatheh/perke/tree/main/examples>`_
directory.
