    SingleRank keyphrase extractor

    This model is an extension of the TextRank model that uses the
    number of co-occurrences to weight edges in the graph.

    Examples
    --------
    .. code:: python

        from perke.unsupervised.graph_based import SingleRank

        # Define the set of valid part of speech tags to occur in the model.
        valid_pos_tags = {'N', 'Ne', 'AJ', 'AJe'}

        # 1. Create a SingleRank extractor.
        extractor = SingleRank(valid_pos_tags=valid_pos_tags)

        # 2. Load the text.
        extractor.load_text(input='text or path/to/input_file',
                            word_normalization_method=None)

        # 3. Select the longest sequences of nouns and adjectives as
        #    candidates.
        extractor.select_candidates()

        # 4. Weight the candidates using the sum of their words weights that
        #    are computed using random walk. In the graph, nodes are certain
        #    parts of speech (nouns and adjectives) that are connected if
        #    they co-occur in a window of 10 words.
