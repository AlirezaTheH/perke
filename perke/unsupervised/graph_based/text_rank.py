class TextRank(Extractor):
    """
    TextRank keyphrase extractor

    This model builds a graph that represents the text. A graph based
    ranking algorithm is then applied to extract the phrases that are
    most important in the text.

    In this implementation, nodes are words of certain parts of speech
    (nouns and adjectives) and edges represent co-occurrence relation,
    controlled by the distance between word occurrences
    (here a window of 2 words). Nodes are weighted by the TextRank
    graph-based weighting algorithm in its unweighted variant.

    Example

    .. code:: python

        from perke.unsupervised.graph_based import TextRank

        # Define the set of valid part of speech tags to occur in the model.
        valid_pos_tags = {'N', 'Ne', 'AJ', 'AJe'}

        # 1. Create a TextRank extractor.
        extractor = TextRank(valid_pos_tags=valid_pos_tags)

        # 2. Load the text.
        extractor.load_text(input='text or path/to/input_file',

        # 3. Build the graph representation of the text and weight the
        #    words. Keyphrase candidates are composed from the 33 percent
        #    highest weighted words.
        extractor.weight_candidates(window_size=2, top_t_percent=0.33)

        # 4. Get the 10 highest weighted candidates as keyphrases.
